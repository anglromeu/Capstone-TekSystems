# XMC_Platoon_Sort

This project was created to help Extreme Military Challenge (xmccamp.com), a youth camp focused in showing teenagers between 13 and 17 years of age,
what they are capale of.

Due to the "once a year" nature of the mission, every hour counts and every staff member has a full schedule.
The goals is to automatically sort recruits into multiple platoons while keeping a balance.
Age and Gender are the only two factors considered when dividing the groups.

Itarating throgh nested lists was the more challenging portion.
All challenges were tackle by a lot of research and the assistance of more knowledgable indivuals, both from the technical and administrative sides.
Special Thanks to Khoi and Ryan Bradley.
